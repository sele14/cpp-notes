- C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free form programming language
  - Statically typed means type checking is performed during compile time rather than run-time
- It supprots OOP, procedural, and generic programming
- Regarded as a middle-level language, combines high-level and low-level language functions
- Was originally named C with classes, changed to C++
- A superset of C, any C program is also a C++ program, but not the other way around

C++ supports the four pillars of OOP development:
- Encapsulation
- Data hiding (abstraction)
- Inheritance
- Polymophism

C++ consists of 3 important parts:
- The core language, has variables, data types, literals etc.
- C++ standard library, gives a rich set of functions, strings, manipulating files etc.
- STL: standard template library; gives a rich set of methods for manipulating data structures etc.

ANSI standard ensures C++ is portable; windows, mac, UNIX etc.
- Not the executables, but the code is cross-platform.

#### Use of C++
- Highly used, particularly in environments where there is hardware constraints.
